#Description
---------------
This is my implementaion of CHIP8 Interpreter in Javascript using WebGL. Currently it is in beta and doesn't support sound. Pong2 runs fine at full speed. I'll be testing it for potential speed enhancements and support for more games.  
  
Also, this is my first Emulation project so it may be a bit rough around the edges.  
  
###Usage :-  
- Launch a local web-server and then run the index.html file through browser. Web-server is required to load the ROM file in memory.
- The Games folder contains ROMs for the emulator, you can add your own games there if you want to test it.
- If you want to load your own ROMs then make appropriate changes to loadProgram funciton in CHIP8.js.
- Information about CHIP8 can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8).
